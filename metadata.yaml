description: Charles Wagner was a French reformed pastor whose inspirational writings
  were influential in shaping liberal reformed theology. In 1904, he was invited to
  preach at the White House by Theodore Roosevelt on whom this book of Wagner's, The
  Simple Life had made a lasting impression. "The spirit of simplicity is a great
  magician. It softens asperities, bridges chasms, draws together hands and hearts.
  The forms which it takes in the world are infinite in number; but never does it
  seem to us more admirable than when it shows itself across the fatal barriers of
  position, interest, or prejudice.
